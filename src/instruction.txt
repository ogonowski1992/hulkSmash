LAUNCH
To launch this application you can user command: java -jar hulkSmash.jar
I recommend to launch this game in some linux console, I was manage to add some colors in app but it work only on linux console.

INTERACTING
When you see text like "[a] - aaaa", its mean that to choose option aaaa you have to write to console "a" and accept it by enter.
All command have to by accepted with "Enter" key.

In game you can move using command:
w - to move up
s - to move down
d - to move right
a - to move left.
and using command:
smash - you can attack enemy
and:
q - to exit game, after that you can save this game which you just ended.

On map:
you are a green rectangle with "0" symbol,
blue space that surrounds you, is fog of war, you can reveal it to find enemy to smash by moving you champion,
enemies are red rectangle with "8" symbol,
obstacles are white rectangle.

You can not go through or destroy obstacle.

You can damage enemy only when you are next to him in one of four directions(top, bottom, left, right). Actually it
depend on skill which you use. But smash works as I described.

EXTEND
I have implemented one fighting system, but application is prepare for other. To do that you have to crate class that
extend FightSystem and pass it to Game constructor.

I have implemented one skill, but application is prepare for other. To do that you have to crate class that extend
AbstractSkill, add some code to FightAction and SkillFactory classes to handle new skills.


I used IntelliJ to crate this application.
